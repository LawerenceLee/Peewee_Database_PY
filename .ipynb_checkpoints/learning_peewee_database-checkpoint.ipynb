    "* The Python class in the Peewee ORM that represents tables in SQL databases are called _Models_.\n",
    "* Each column or attribute in a table is an attribute of the model class.\n",
    "* Since ORMs usually sanitize the queries they run against your database, a common benefit of using an ORM is that you're protected against malicious queries.\n",
    "* The db extension is not required, its just a convention used in peewee to signify a file is a database.\n",
    "* Notice that our class name is singular and not plural. This is because classes in Peewee represent a single item in a database. This convention is also used heacily in Jango."

    "* `Model` - The Peewee class that we extend to make a model\n",
    "* `CharField` - A Peewee field that holds onto characters. It's a varchar in SQL terms\n",
    "* `max_length` - The maximum number of characters in a CharField\n",
    "* `IntegerField` - A Peewee field that holds an integer\n",
    "* `default` - A default value for the field if one isn't provided\n",

    "* `.connect()` - A database method that connects to the database\n",
    "* `.create_tables()` - A database method to create the tables for the specified models.\n",
    "* `safe` - Whether or not to throw errors if the table(s) you're attempting to create already exist\n",
    "* `Meta` - This class tells the model class which database it belongs to. (this is NOT an actual Meta class, its just called one. BTW this convention is also seen in Jango)\n",
